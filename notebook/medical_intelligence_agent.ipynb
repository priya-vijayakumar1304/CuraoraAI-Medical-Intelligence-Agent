            What is TB?\\r\\n                                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affect the lungs. About one-quarter of the world's population has been infected with TB, most of whom are not ill and cannot transmit TB. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                        How many people die from TB disease?\\r\\n                                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTB is the world's leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. In 2023, 1.25 million people died from TB. This includes 161\\xa0000 individuals who were also living with HIV.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                        How does TB infection differ from TB disease?\\r\\n                                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMost people infected with TB bacteria do not have TB disease, but they can develop TB. The lifetime risk of falling ill with TB is on average about 5-10%. However, persons with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a much higher risk of developing TB disease. When a person develops TB disease, they may only have mild symptoms, and some have no symptoms at all. This can lead to delays in seeking care and continued transmission of the bacteria to others. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                        What are the symptoms of TB disease?\\r\\n                                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTuberculosis (TB) often affects the lungs and can lead to several symptoms. Common signs of active TB include a persistent cough, sometimes with mucus or even blood. People might also experience chest pain, weakness or fatigue, unintentional weight loss, fever and night sweats. It's important to remember that these symptoms can be mild at first and develop slowly. If you experience these signs, seeking medical attention is crucial for diagnosis and treatment of TB.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                        How does TB spread?\\r\\n                                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected. People with untreated TB can infect up to 10–15 other people through close contact over one year.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                        How is TB treated?\\r\\n                                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTuberculosis is mostly curable but without proper treatment about two thirds of people who get TB will die. Since 2000, about 79 million lives have been saved through effective diagnosis and treatment. Most people who have TB disease can be cured with a course of 4 antimicrobials lasting 6 months, or even 4 months in some cases. Information, supervision and patient support by a health worker or trained volunteer are key to a successful outcome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                        How is TB prevented?\\r\\n                                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTuberculosis is largely preventable. TB preventive treatment (TPT) can be given to avoid progression from TB infection to disease in people at risk. TB screening and action on poverty, malnutrition, HIV, diabetes and tobacco are some of the population measures that can reduce TB burden. The currently licensed vaccine – BCG – protects from severe forms of TB and from deaths from TB, especially in young children.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO TEAM\\n\\n\\nGlobal Programme on Tuberculosis and Lung Health (GTB) \\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\nWHO's work on tuberculosis\\nNews\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO issues call to action: prioritize pregnant and lactating women in TB research\\n22 August 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO releases new Target Product Profiles for tuberculosis screening tests\\n13 August 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFact sheets\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTuberculosis\\n14 March 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRegions\\n\\n\\nAfrica\\n\\n\\nAmericas\\n\\n\\nEastern Mediterranean\\n\\n\\nEurope\\n\\n\\nSouth-East Asia\\n\\n\\nWestern Pacific\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPolicies\\n\\n\\nCybersecurity\\n\\n\\nEthics\\n\\n\\nInformation disclosure\\n\\n\\nPermissions and licensing\\n\\n\\nPreventing sexual exploitation\\n\\n\\nTerms of use\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n\\nFrequently asked questions\\n\\n\\nLibrary\\n\\n\\nProcurement\\n\\n\\nPublications\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact us\\n\\n\\n\\nNewsletters\\n\\n\\nReport misconduct\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n         \\n\\nPrivacy policy\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\r\\n                                ©\\r\\n                            \\r\\n\\r\\n                            2025\\r\\n\\r\\n                            \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nWHO\\n\\n                           \\n\")]"

Despite policies, including Minister of Health Regulation No. 67/2016 and Presidential Regulation No. 67/2021, along with the National TB Strategy for Tuberculosis Control 2020-2024 have been implemented, targets remain unmet due to weak community involvement. This study analyzed TB policy implementation in high-prevalence Banyumas Regency, focusing on cadres and community organizations.\\nDESIGN AND METHODS: This qualitative study employed the Van Meter and Van Horn framework to assess policy implementation. Key stakeholders involved informants from Puskesmas (community health centers), TB cadres, TB program holders at the Regency Health Office, and the Mentari Sehat Indonesia Foundation. Data collection involved in-depth interviews with these informants, as well as policy documents, guidelines, and reports from agencies or institutions. Triangulation methods were used to enhance the validity of the findings.\\nRESULTS: Implementers understood policy standards, supported by consistent communication among Health Offices, community health workers, local organizations, and village leaders. Positive attitudes were reflected in joint commitments and Regional Action Plans. Cadres and communities actively supported case-finding, treatment, education, socioeconomic aid, and stigma reduction.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Policies lack sufficient local budget allocation. Weak motivation of TB cadres, lack of commitment among regional organizations, and persistent stigma in the community are evident. The Global Fund aids DR-TB control through grants and patient support to ensure treatment adherence. However, sustained impact requires government attention to policy, human resources, infrastructure, and complementary resources to achieve synergy.'),\n",

Mucormycosis is even rarer in immunocompetent patients. In this case report, we present a case of co-infection of mucormycosis and aspergillosis in a young female with no comorbidities and no immunosuppression. A 27-year-old female patient presents with a history of hemoptysis and intermittent fever for a year with associated history of weight loss. She also has a history of tuberculosis for which she completed treatment. There is no history of any known comorbidity or immunosuppression. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was suggestive of air crescent sign involving the right upper lobe. The patient underwent right upper lobectomy through a right posterolateral approach. Histopathology was suggestive of a fungal ball (mucormycosis and aspergillosis). The patient was administered liposomal amphotericin B intravenously for 14 days and oral posaconazole 300 mg for 3 months. Postoperative follow-up period of 3 and 6 months was uneventful. Mucormycosis and aspergillosis are rare co-infections that could potentially lead to death. These infections usually occur in the immunocompromised population but a high index of suspicion is needed also in immunocompetent patients. Early detection by a multidisciplinary approach, appropriate antifungal therapy, and, if necessary, surgical resection are essential in the treatment of this co-infection. There is no clear consensus on the treatment of mixed co-infections that respond differently to standard treatment protocols; hence, antimicrobial therapy must be rationalized.'),\n",

In resource-limited settings, establishing a definitive diagnosis for patients with pleural effusion (PEs) may be challenging, emphasizing the need for a simple diagnostic test. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of quantitative C-reactive protein (qCRP) for differentiating between tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) and malignant pleural effusion (MPE).\\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on 81 patients admitted for lymphocyte-rich exudative pleural effusion at a tertiary care center. Comprehensive biochemical analyses, including qCRP levels in the pleural fluid and pathological examinations of blood, pleural fluid, and/or tissue, were performed. The t-test was used for continuous variables, and the chi-square test was used for categorical variables. To assess the independent associations between variables, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. The diagnostic performance of pleural fluid qCRP levels was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.\\nRESULTS: Forty-four (54.3%) patients were diagnosed with TPE and 34 (42.0%) with MPE. The qCRP levels in the pleural fluid were significantly greater in the TPE group than in the MPE group (55.5\\u2009±\\u200945.9\\xa0mg/L vs. 18.6\\u2009±\\u200919.1\\xa0mg/L, \\u2009<\\u20090.001). The cutoff value for pleural fluid CRP levels (≥\\u200924.1\\xa0mg/L) yielded a sensitivity of 65.9% and a specificity of 73.5% in predicting TPE.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Pleural fluid qCRP is a simple, rapid, cost-effective diagnostic tool for differentiating tuberculous from malignant etiology in patients with lymphocyte-rich exudative pleural effusion.\\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12055-025-01978-9.')]"

      "PURPOSE: Pulmonary or pleural tuberculosis and malignancy are the most common causes of lymphocyte-rich pleural effusion. In resource-limited settings, establishing a definitive diagnosis for patients with pleural effusion (PEs) may be challenging, emphasizing the need for a simple diagnostic test. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of quantitative C-reactive protein (qCRP) for differentiating between tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) and malignant pleural effusion (MPE).\n",
      "METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on 81 patients admitted for lymphocyte-rich exudative pleural effusion at a tertiary care center. Comprehensive biochemical analyses, including qCRP levels in the pleural fluid and pathological examinations of blood, pleural fluid, and/or tissue, were performed. The t-test was used for continuous variables, and the chi-square test was used for categorical variables. To assess the independent associations between variables, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. The diagnostic performance of pleural fluid qCRP levels was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.\n",
      "RESULTS: Forty-four (54.3%) patients were diagnosed with TPE and 34 (42.0%) with MPE. The qCRP levels in the pleural fluid were significantly greater in the TPE group than in the MPE group (55.5 ± 45.9 mg/L vs. 18.6 ± 19.1 mg/L,  < 0.001). The cutoff value for pleural fluid CRP levels (≥ 24.1 mg/L) yielded a sensitivity of 65.9% and a specificity of 73.5% in predicting TPE.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Pleural fluid qCRP is a simple, rapid, cost-effective diagnostic tool for differentiating tuberculous from malignant etiology in patients with lymphocyte-rich exudative pleural effusion.\n",
